## Create a Burger ordering system

This one is simple. Or, it should be. You are building a burger ordering system for a burger restaurant. The system should output the cost of the burger, along with a list of it's components.

Each basic cost is listed next to it in parentheses. If an ingredient is premium, it's price is more expensive listed next to it in the options. A burger may have none of a type of ingredient or as many as the customer wants:

| ------------- | ----------- |
| Buns | white, whole wheat, gluten free ($2) |
| Sauces ($0.25) | mustard, ketchup, mayo, relish, BBQ ($0.50) |
| Vegetables (0.50)| lettuce, tomatoes, onions, pickles |
| Patty ($1) | beef, chicken, veggie, beyond meat (\$3) |
