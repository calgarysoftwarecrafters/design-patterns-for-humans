I own a construction supply company in Rohan and I build houses, so I need a lot of doors. Do you think you can help me by building a door factory?

_Simple Factory_
At first, I will just need basic square doors of varying sizes. Each door should come back in the width and height I request.
Each door should also have a price. Price is calculated by multiplying the area of the door by the per-square-foot cost of the material the door is made out of. Since our buisiness is just starting out, I'll only be building Rohanese long houses so I'll only need doors made out of wood (1 pening / sqft).

_Factory Method_
After I've cornered the longhouse buisiness in Rohan, I'm going to want to expand. I'll start selling houses to the humans south of the mountains in Gondor, the orcs to the south west, and the dwarves of Khazad-dun! As an extra challenge, I might even build houses for the hobbits of the shire!

Each of these races has a different sence of style. The humans of Rohan (and the hobbits!)like their doors made out of basic wood, but the Gondorians are more fancy. They require doors made out of steel. The orcs want animal-hide doors and the dwarves want doors made out of iron.

Each material has a different price according to this price sheet:

| Customer Type | Material    | price (penning/sqft) |
| ------------- | ----------- | -------------------- |
| Rohan         | wood        | 1                    |
| Gondorian     | steel       | 5                    |
| Orc           | animal hide | 2                    |
| Dwarf         | iron        | 3                    |

Hobbits are extra-challenging because they have round doors, which means they calculate price slightly differently.
